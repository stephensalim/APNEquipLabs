      <description>Before launching a new instance, you will need to configure a new VPC, subnet, internet gateway and routes. All activities should be performed in the us-west-1 region (N. California).
 In AWS console ensure that you are accessing the West-1 region, navigate to VPC.
 In the left navigation pane click &amp;ldquo;Your VPCs&amp;rdquo;
 Click Create VPC then configure:
   Name tag: West VPC
 IPv4 CIDR block: 10.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/iam-lab/create-iam-group/</guid>
      <description>To get started, go to the IAM dashboard in the AWS console.  An IAM group is a collection of users. Groups are often based on job function or role. They allow you to manage permissions by applying policies to each group rather than individual users.
 Go to Groups in the sidebar and click on Create New Group.
 Type in Power_Users as the Group Name. Go to the Next Step.</description>

      <title>1. Navigate the VPC Dashboard</title>
      <link>http://example.org/vpc-lab/navigate-the-vpc-dashboard/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/vpc-lab/navigate-the-vpc-dashboard/</guid>
      <description>To get started, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the VPC Dashboard.
In every region, a default VPC has already been created for you. So, even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t created anything in your account yet, you will see some VPC resources already there.
In this lab, we will be using the VPC Wizard to create a VPC with private and public subnets pre-configured. Once you&amp;rsquo;re more familiar with AWS networking, you can create VPCs and subnets without the Wizard to create custom networking configurations.</description>

      <title>1. Solutions Overview</title>
      <link>http://example.org/ami-inspector-lab/solutions_overview/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://example.org/ami-inspector-lab/solutions_overview/</guid>
      <description>Here is the overview on how this solution works :
 A scheduled CloudWatch Events event will trigger the AWS Lambda function called StartContinuousAssessment.
 This function will then pulls metadata information containing the golden AMI ID, Instance type, and instructions to prepare the EC2 instance for inspection from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
 For each of the AMI specified in the metadata, StartContinuousAssessment Lambda function will create an EC2 instance.</description>

      <title>2. Add Object to S3 Bucket</title>
      <link>http://example.org/s3-lab/add-object-to-s3-bucket/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://example.org/s3-lab/add-object-to-s3-bucket/</guid>
      <description>Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve created a bucket, you&amp;rsquo;re ready to add an object to it. An object can be any kind of file: a text file, a photo, a video and so forth. When you add a file to Amazon S3, you have the option of including metadata with the file and setting permissions to control access to the file.
 In the Amazon S3 console, click the on the name of the bucket to which you want to upload an object (not the bucket icon itself, though), and then click Upload in the Objects tab.</description>

      <title>2. Configure a Security Group</title>
      <link>http://example.org/ec2-lab-windows/configure-security-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://example.org/ec2-lab-windows/configure-security-group/</guid>
      <description>You will now create a security group which will allow remote desktop (RDP) access to an EC2 instance.
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC could be assigned to a different set of security groups.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/iam-lab/create-iam-user/</guid>
      <description>It is best practice to create a different user for each person who needs AWS access. A user is associated with permanent credentials and has permissions based off of policies attached directly to the user or policies attached to a group to which the user belongs.
 Go to Users in the sidebar and click on Add user.
Enter a unique name as the User name. In this walkthrough, I chose Emily as the username.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/ami-inspector-lab/tag_golden_ami/</guid>
      <description>Before we start anything in this solution the first thing we need to do is have the Subject Golden AMI. Now to do this, you can either create your own AMI basing from existing instance running AMI Amazon Linux 2 by following this Guide or you can just use the Amazon public AMI. The following instructions will assume you are using Amazon public AMI. In this part of the lab, we will be applying Tag to the AMI so that our solution can identify information about the AMI.</description>

      <description>In AWS Security is at highest priority, through working directly with CloudFormation, you will discover layers of security construct that you could customize to secure your resource. One of it is IAM role, for cross service interactions AWS will levarage security services to create isolation and security boundaries on the service executed.
In this part of the Lab we will be defining an IAM role that we will attach to our AWS Lambda function and specify permissions for the Lambda function to access only the services and resource we allow it to.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/vpc-lab/test-private-ec2-instance/</guid>
      <description>Optionally, you can go through the same process in the last two sections in order to test access to a private EC2 instance. The only difference will be in the Configure Instance Details section, you will select the Private subnet. Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through attaching an Elastic IP, in the same section, you can select Enable under Auto-assign Public IP. Remember that this is not best practice for public facing resources, but in this case the instance will not be reachable anyways because the private subnet does not have an IGW route.</description>

      <description>In this lab you have learned the basic operations to manage the lifecycle of an S3 object. First, you created a bucket, which is the logical container of objects. Then by uploading, viewing, moving an object, and enabling versioning, you learned the basic operations of the object itself. Finally, you learned how to delete both an object and a bucket.
You should continue exploring more features of S3!

      <guid>http://example.org/monitoring-lab/monitor-ec2-tag/</guid>
      <description>In this scenario, you create an AWS Config rule, that will monitor your EC2 instance resources in the region for a tag named &amp;ldquo;CostCenter&amp;rdquo; and value &amp;ldquo;1000&amp;rdquo; to signify that the cost of this instance is being tracked. If the EC2 instance does not have CostCenter tag, You can then set up reconfig-mediation using AWS-StopEC2Instance AWS Systems Manager Automation.
 From the AWS console click Services &amp;gt; Config.
If this is the first time you enabled AWS Config, your console will direct you to the &amp;ldquo;Get Started Page&amp;rdquo;.</description>
