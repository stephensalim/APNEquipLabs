      <description>Before launching a new instance, you will need to configure a new VPC, subnet, internet gateway and routes. All activities should be performed in the us-west-1 region (N. California).
 In AWS console ensure that you are accessing the West-1 region, navigate to VPC.
 In the left navigation pane click &amp;ldquo;Your VPCs&amp;rdquo;
 Click Create VPC then configure:
   Name tag: West VPC
 IPv4 CIDR block: 10.</description>

      <title>1. Create IAM Group</title>
      <link>http://example.org/iam-lab/create-iam-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://example.org/iam-lab/create-iam-group/</guid>
      <description>To get started, go to the IAM dashboard in the AWS console.  An IAM group is a collection of users. Groups are often based on job function or role. They allow you to manage permissions by applying policies to each group rather than individual users.
 Go to Groups in the sidebar and click on Create New Group.
 Type in Power_Users as the Group Name. Go to the Next Step.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/ec2-lab/create-new-key-pair/</guid>
      <description>In this lab, you will need to create an EC2 instance using an SSH keypair. The following steps outline creating a unique SSH keypair for you to use in this lab.
 Sign into the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2.
 In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, confirm you are in the desired AWS region (e.g., Sydney).
 Click on Key Pairs in the NETWORK &amp;amp; SECURITY section near the bottom of the leftmost menu.</description>

      <title>1. Create S3 Bucket</title>
      <link>http://example.org/s3-lab/create-s3-bucket/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://example.org/s3-lab/create-s3-bucket/</guid>
      <description>Every object in Amazon S3 is stored in a bucket. Before you can store data in Amazon S3 you must create a bucket.
*Note: You are not charged for creating a bucket; you are only charged for storing objects in the bucket and for transferring objects in and out of the bucket.*
 Sign into the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3]{.underline}.
 Click Create Bucket.</description>

      <title>1. Navigate the VPC Dashboard</title>
      <link>http://example.org/vpc-lab/navigate-the-vpc-dashboard/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://example.org/vpc-lab/navigate-the-vpc-dashboard/</guid>
      <description>To get started, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the VPC Dashboard.
In every region, a default VPC has already been created for you. So, even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t created anything in your account yet, you will see some VPC resources already there.
In this lab, we will be using the VPC Wizard to create a VPC with private and public subnets pre-configured. Once you&amp;rsquo;re more familiar with AWS networking, you can create VPCs and subnets without the Wizard to create custom networking configurations.</description>

      <title>2. Add Object to S3 Bucket</title>
      <link>http://example.org/s3-lab/add-object-to-s3-bucket/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://example.org/s3-lab/add-object-to-s3-bucket/</guid>
      <description>Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve created a bucket, you&amp;rsquo;re ready to add an object to it. An object can be any kind of file: a text file, a photo, a video and so forth. When you add a file to Amazon S3, you have the option of including metadata with the file and setting permissions to control access to the file.
 In the Amazon S3 console, click the on the name of the bucket to which you want to upload an object (not the bucket icon itself, though), and then click Upload in the Objects tab.</description>

      <title>2. Configure a Security Group</title>
      <link>http://example.org/ec2-lab-windows/configure-security-group/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://example.org/ec2-lab-windows/configure-security-group/</guid>
      <description>You will now create a security group which will allow remote desktop (RDP) access to an EC2 instance.
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance. Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC could be assigned to a different set of security groups.</description>

      <title>2. Create IAM User</title>
      <link>http://example.org/iam-lab/create-iam-user/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://example.org/iam-lab/create-iam-user/</guid>
      <description>It is best practice to create a different user for each person who needs AWS access. A user is associated with permanent credentials and has permissions based off of policies attached directly to the user or policies attached to a group to which the user belongs.
 Go to Users in the sidebar and click on Add user.
Enter a unique name as the User name. In this walkthrough, I chose Emily as the username.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/ec2-lab/browse-your-web-server/</guid>
      <description>Wait for the instance to pass the Status Checks to finish loading.
Finished initializing   Open a new browser tab and browse the Web Server by entering the EC2 instance&amp;rsquo;s Public DNS name into the browser. The EC2 instance&amp;rsquo;s Public DNS name can be found in the console by reviewing the &amp;ldquo;Public DNS&amp;rdquo; name line highlighted above.
You should see a website that looks like the following:</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/ec2-lab-windows/configure-an-iam-user-and-policy/</guid>
      <description>Next you will work in the Identity and Access Management service (IAM) to create a user and define a custom policy which will restrict EC2 instance launch to a specific (US-West-1) region.
 Navigate to the IAM console
 In the IAM console click Policies on the left
 Click Create Policy
 In the Create Policy page, click the JSON tab.
 Copy the following following text and replace all of the text in the JSON tab:</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/iam-lab/create-iam-role/</guid>
      <description>IAM Roles can be assumed by AWS services, IAM users, or applications. They are assigned temporary rather than permanent credentials whenever assumed. Using roles for privileged permissions sets (such as the PowerUserAccess policy) can help improve your security posture since credential exposure is minimized.
 Go to Roles in the sidebar and click on Create Role.
 On the Select type of trusted identity page, you decide who or what will be able to assume this role.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/vpc-lab/test-private-ec2-instance/</guid>
      <description>Optionally, you can go through the same process in the last two sections in order to test access to a private EC2 instance. The only difference will be in the Configure Instance Details section, you will select the Private subnet. Also, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through attaching an Elastic IP, in the same section, you can select Enable under Auto-assign Public IP. Remember that this is not best practice for public facing resources, but in this case the instance will not be reachable anyways because the private subnet does not have an IGW route.</description>

      <description>In this lab you have learned the basic operations to manage the lifecycle of an S3 object. First, you created a bucket, which is the logical container of objects. Then by uploading, viewing, moving an object, and enabling versioning, you learned the basic operations of the object itself. Finally, you learned how to delete both an object and a bucket.
You should continue exploring more features of S3!
 Did you know you can host a website entirely on S3?</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/monitoring-lab/monitor-ec2-tag/</guid>
      <description>In this scenario, you create an AWS Config rule, that will monitor your EC2 instance resources in the region for a tag named &amp;ldquo;CostCenter&amp;rdquo; and value &amp;ldquo;1000&amp;rdquo; to signify that the cost of this instance is being tracked. If the EC2 instance does not have CostCenter tag, You can then set up reconfig-mediation using AWS-StopEC2Instance AWS Systems Manager Automation.
 From the AWS console click Services &amp;gt; Config.
If this is the first time you enabled AWS Config, your console will direct you to the &amp;ldquo;Get Started Page&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In this scenario, you create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that will monitor your estimated Amazon Web Services (AWS) charges. When you enable the monitoring of estimated charges for your AWS account, the estimated charges are calculated and sent several times daily to CloudWatch as metric data that is stored for 14 days. Billing metric data is stored in the US East (N. Virginia) Region and represents worldwide charges. This data includes the estimated charges for every service in AWS that you use, as well as the estimated overall total of your AWS charges.</description>
