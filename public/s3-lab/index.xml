      <description>Every object in Amazon S3 is stored in a bucket. Before you can store data in Amazon S3 you must create a bucket.
*Note: You are not charged for creating a bucket; you are only charged for storing objects in the bucket and for transferring objects in and out of the bucket.*
 Sign into the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3]{.underline}.
 Click Create Bucket.</description>

      <title>Add Object to S3 Bucket</title>

      <guid>http://example.org/s3-lab/add-object-to-s3-bucket/</guid>
      <description>Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve created a bucket, you&amp;rsquo;re ready to add an object to it. An object can be any kind of file: a text file, a photo, a video and so forth. When you add a file to Amazon S3, you have the option of including metadata with the file and setting permissions to control access to the file.
 In the Amazon S3 console, click the on the name of the bucket to which you want to upload an object (not the bucket icon itself, though), and then click Upload in the Objects tab.</description>

      <title>Move S3 Object</title>

      <description>Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve added an object to a bucket and viewed it, you might like to move the object to a different bucket or folder.
 In the Amazon S3 console, create a new bucket (reference earlier section for details).
 Select the first bucket you created and view the list of objects.
 Select the object(s) you want to move by clicking the selection box to their left. You can ignore the info box that opens when you select an object.</description>

      <title>Enable Bucket Versioning</title>
      <link>http://example.org/s3-lab/enable-bucket-versioning/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/s3-lab/enable-bucket-versioning/</guid>
      <description>If you want to add new version of the object to the same bucket but want to retain the old version, you can turn on bucket versioning.
 In the S3 Console, click on the link representing the bucket you created, and then select the Properties tab.
 Click on the Versioning tile, select the Enable versioning radio button, and then click Save.
 Choose an object that you are able to edit on your computer, and upload it using the steps from the Add an Object to a Bucket section above.</description>

      <title>Delete an Object and Bucket</title>
      <link>http://example.org/s3-lab/delete-an-object-and-bucket/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/s3-lab/delete-an-object-and-bucket/</guid>
      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve added an object to a bucket, viewed it, and moved it. Now, you can delete it and the bucket it&amp;rsquo;s in.
If you no longer need to store the objects you uploaded and moved while going through this guide, you should delete them so you do not incur further charges on those objects.
 In the Amazon S3 console, click on the link representing the bucket containing the object(s) you want to delete.</description>

      <description>In this lab you have learned the basic operations to manage the lifecycle of an S3 object. First, you created a bucket, which is the logical container of objects. Then by uploading, viewing, moving an object, and enabling versioning, you learned the basic operations of the object itself. Finally, you learned how to delete both an object and a bucket.
You should continue exploring more features of S3!
 Did you know you can host a website entirely on S3?</description>
