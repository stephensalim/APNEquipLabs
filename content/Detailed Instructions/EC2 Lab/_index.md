Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides
resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2's simple web service
interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal
friction. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new
server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity,
both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2
changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for
capacity that you actually use.

This lab will walk you through launching, configuring, and customizing
an EC2 web server using the AWS Management Console.
