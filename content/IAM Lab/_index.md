**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a free service that enables
you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM,
you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to
allow and deny their access to AWS resources.Â 

In the following lab, you will create one of each of the three types of
AWS IAM entities: groups, users, and roles. You will also learn about
IAM policy documents, which you can attach to entities in order to give
them permissions to access AWS resources and services.
