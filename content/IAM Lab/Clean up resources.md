If you want to clean up your account to get rid of everything we created
during this lab, follow the instructions in this section. You can also
leave your lab environment running if you want to test other AWS IAM
concepts.

1.  Go to **Groups** in the sidebar. Select the **Power\_Users** group and
go to the **Group Actions** dropdown. Select **Delete Group** and then
**Yes, Delete**.

2. Go to **Users** in the sidebar. Select the user you created and select
**Delete user**. Select the **checkbox** and then **Yes, delete**.

3. Go to **Roles** in the sidebar. Type in **EC2\_S3ReadOnly** in the
search bar. Select the role and then click on **Delete role**. Since we
didn't actually use this role and there was no recent activity, the
pop-up window will not ask for a confirmation. Click **Yes, delete**.
