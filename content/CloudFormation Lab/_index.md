This lab will walk the user through using the AWS CloudFormation to
create a VPC with public and private subnets, describe each of the
objects created by the AWS CloudFormation, and launch VPC with the
public and private VPC subnets, RouteTable, Elastic IP NAT Gateway, and
S3 bucket.

The following is a high-level overview of this lab:
-   Explore the initial AWS CloudFormation template
-   Explore the different VPC objects and what they mean
-   Launch AWS CloudFormation by creating Stack from Console.
-   Export VPC ID, NAT Gateway ID and S3 bucket URL to output tab

The lab will provide an initial template for users to explore . after
creating VPC stack from an initial template, users need to complete
provided objective to achieve the final solution.

**Note:** Screenshots are provided to guide you through the steps in the
lab. The elements that you will create (e.g. VPC, NAT Gateway, EIP) will
be unique to your account, so things such as VPC ID that you see in the
console will not necessarily mirror what's seen in the screenshot.
