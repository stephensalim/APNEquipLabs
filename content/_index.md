<h4>Welcome to APN Equip Lab !</h4>

The Lab assumes you already have an AWS account setup, and have direct unrestricted access to your AWS console.<br>
If you don't have AWS account set up, please follow this [Link](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) to set one up.
Each Lab are built independently of each other so you can pick and choose your module as preffered 

<br>

<!--
<h4>Guidelines</h4>
* Attempt to do the lab using **High Level instructions** instead of the Detailed instructions.<br>
* Each high level instructions will include **AWS public documentation** that you could **review** to put things together.<br>
* Use the **Detailed Instructions** only if you are desperate or you are completely new to AWS.<br>
* **Take time** to **explore** the service your are building during the Lab.<br>
* **Ask Question**, we are here to help :)

<h1>HAVE FUN !!</h1>
