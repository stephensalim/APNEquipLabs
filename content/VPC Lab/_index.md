**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** lets you provision a logically
isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in
a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your
virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP
address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables
and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for
secure and easy access to resources and applications. 

In this lab, you will learn how to set up a VPC with public and private
subnets. You will also learn about AWS networking concepts such as
Elastic IPs, NAT Gateways.
