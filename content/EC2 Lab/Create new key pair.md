In this lab, you will need to create an EC2 instance using an SSH
keypair. The following steps outline creating a unique SSH keypair for
you to use in this lab.

1.  Sign into the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console
    at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2>.

2.  In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, confirm you
    are in the desired AWS region (e.g., Sydney).

3.  Click on **Key Pairs** in the NETWORK & SECURITY section near the
    bottom of the leftmost menu. This will display a page to manage your
    SSH key pairs.
