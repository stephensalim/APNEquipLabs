Now that you've added an object to a bucket and viewed it, you might
like to move the object to a different bucket or folder.

1.  In the Amazon S3 console, create a new bucket (reference earlier
    section for details).
    
2.  Select the first bucket you created and view the list of objects.

3.  Select the object(s) you want to move by clicking the selection box
    to their left. You can ignore the info box that opens when you
    select an object.
    
4.  Once you've selected your files, click on the **More** button, and
    then click **Cut**.
    
5.  Navigate to the target bucket (and folder, if applicable) to which
    you want to move the object, click the **More** button and then
    click **Paste**. At the **Cut and paste** review dialogue, confirm
    the action by clicking **Paste**.

	***Note: When you move an object across buckets the previously set
	object permissions will persist by default.***
	
	**Congratulations - you have now moved an object between buckets.**
