You've added an object to a bucket, viewed it, and moved it. Now, you
can delete it and the bucket it's in.

If you no longer need to store the objects you uploaded and moved while
going through this guide, you should delete them so you do not incur
further charges on those objects.

1.  In the Amazon S3 console, click on the link representing the
    bucket containing the object(s) you want to delete. Then select the
    object(s).

2.  Click the **More** button, followed by **Delete**. To confirm the
    action in the **Delete objects** dialogue, click **Delete**.

3.  Navigate back to the S3 console and select the bucket icon of the
    bucket you want to delete (not the link to its right), and at the
    top of the page, click **Delete bucket**. Confirm the deletion by
    typing its name verbatim at the **Delete bucket** prompt.

**Well done, your bucket is now deleted!**
