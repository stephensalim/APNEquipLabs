In this lab you have learned the basic operations to manage the
lifecycle of an S3 object. First, you created a bucket, which is the
logical container of objects. Then by uploading, viewing, moving an
object, and enabling versioning, you learned the basic operations of the
object itself. Finally, you learned how to delete both an object and a
bucket.

You should continue exploring more features of S3!

-   *Did you know you can host a website entirely on S3?*
-   *Did you know you can define automated lifecycle policies?*
-   *How about fine-grained access control with Bucket Policy?*
