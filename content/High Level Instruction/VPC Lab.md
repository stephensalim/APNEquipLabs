**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** lets you provision a logically
isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in
a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your
virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP
address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables
and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for
secure and easy access to resources and applications. 

In this lab, you will learn how to set up a VPC with public and private
subnets. You will also learn about AWS networking concepts such as
Elastic IPs, NAT Gateways.

**Challenge**

Review the Documentation references to achieve the following

1. Use the VPC Wizard to create a new VPC
	* Use both Public and Private subnets
2. Create an Elastic IP
3. Review your new VPC and draw out the complete deployment including:
	* Subnets
	* Internet Gateway
	* NAT Gateway
	* Security groups
	* Network Access List

**Additional challenge**

1. Create a Public EC2 instance into the new VPC
	* Use t2.micro and amazon Linux 2 AMI assign network to new VPC
2. Test public access
	* Assign a new Elastic IP to the instance
	* Ensure security group and NACL allow EC2 to communicate
3. Is there another way to achieve public access without an elastic IP?
4. Clean up your account
	* Terminate EC2 instance
	* Release any Elastic IPâ€™s
	* Delete NAT Gateway and the VPC
