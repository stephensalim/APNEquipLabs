**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a free service that enables
you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM,
you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to
allow and deny their access to AWS resources. 

In the following lab, you will create one of each of the three types of
AWS IAM entities: groups, users, and roles. You will also learn about
IAM policy documents, which you can attach to entities in order to give
them permissions to access AWS resources and services.

**Challenge**

1. Create an IAM Group “Power_Users”. 
	Attach policy called “PowerUserAccess” to the Group
	(Review JSON content and ask Questions if in doubt)
2. Create an IAM User with console & programmatic	access (tip: make note of the programmatic info)
3. Make new user part of “power_User” group created
4. Test new user log in to AWS via console and verify access level
5. Grand “IAMFullAccess” policy to user created.
6. Verify new access level.

**Additional challenge/question**

1. Create an IAM Role that allows an EC2 instance to read files in S3
2. Tips:
	* Trusted identity should be AWS service “EC2”
	* Use AWS Managed policy with S3 Read only access
	* Verify attributes, can you change duration to 3 hours?
	* Review JSON code, ask if in doubt
